# Learning TypeScript

This is a project I'm creating to teach myself TypeScript

## Notes
I will be writing notes within this readme file to refer to in future projects.

### Basics
Superset to JS
Use stricter types - prevents errors
Has extra features that JS doesn't

Within terminal - tsc <filename> -w
 - will create a compiled js file with the same name
 - if both files are open at the same time the variables in ts file will error - just close the js file to fix
 - the -w means that ts will watch that file and compile automatically
